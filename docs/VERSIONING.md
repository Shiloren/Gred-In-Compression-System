## Deprecation Policy

- **Archived versions** (v1.1, v1.2) are **read-only**.
- **v1.3 legacy files** archived at `GICS-ARCHIVE/versions/v1.3-legacy/`.
- **v1.3.0** is the current source of truth.

Released from `dev/v1.3.2` branch.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Daemon Mode**: Persistent process with MemTable, WAL, IPC (JSON-RPC 2.0)
  - **Tier Engine**: HOT/WARM/COLD with auto-flush, compaction, rotation, tier index
  - **Insight Engine**: Behavioral Tracker (velocity, entropy, volatility, streaks, fieldTrends, lifecycle), Correlation Analyzer (co-movement, clusters, leading indicators, seasonal patterns), Predictive Signals (anomaly detection, trend forecasting, recommendations)
  - **File Locking**: Cross-platform shared/exclusive locks for concurrent access
  - **Python Client SDK**: Zero-dependency sync/async client with connection pooling
  - **Zero new runtime dependencies**: All intelligence uses pure incremental statistics
- **Roadmap**: See [GICS_ROADMAP_v1_3_2.md](./roadmaps/GICS_ROADMAP_v1_3_2.md)
